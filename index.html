              <p> As a senior editor, i mainly focus on grammar, and also present the story in an interesting way for the reader because the reader's good experience is important to keep them interested to continue reading the manuscript that I work on. As for the manuscript editing, I also ensure that the manuscript that I work on is not differ from the original and does not misleading the reader.</p>
              <p> In my current company, i learned how to communicate with my teammates that consists of several translators and editors. Here, I learned a lot about leadership and also two-way communication, because I think a problem can be solved if we can openly discuss our opinion and find the best solution to the problem. I am interested in working as an editor, creative worker, public relations, marketing, and administration staff, because i have an education background and experience that matches with the criteria that you need.</p>
